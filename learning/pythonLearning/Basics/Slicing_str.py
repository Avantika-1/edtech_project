#Slicing
#You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.
#Specify the start index and the end index,
#separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.

b = "Avantika"
print(b[2:5])

#Slice from start
b = "Avantika"
print(b[:5])

#Slice To the End
b = "Avantika"
print(b[2:]) #Get the characters from position 2, and all the way to the end:

#Negative Indexing
#Use negative indexes to start the slice from the end of the string:
b = "Avantika"
print(b[-5:-1])
# o/p  "nti" will be -5 poiton[n] to -2 podition [k]
